Thanks for stopping by and giving this page your time. I really appreciate it. Lately, I've been really trying to improve myself and my skills. This is simple just a part of that!

### What I've Been Up To So Far

1. **Discovering Astro**: Looking for a framework to build a portfolio was the first thing. I discovered astro and it looked perfect for my use case!

2. **Gym Progress**: It hasn't been much, but it's been enough. Just a light workout each day, even if only for 30 minutes. Mainly just a treadmill walk.

3. **Creating**: Rather than playing games, I've been creating for the game I play! Minecraft textures, Roblox animations... I've just been trying to polish my skills in multiple ways.

### What's next

Finishing my portfolio is the main thing. I want a nice slate to work with. After that, I can just continue on my projects and when I'm proud of a specific one, I can upload it in a couple steps!
